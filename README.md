## Overview

Install and manage TSM (Tivoli Storage Manager) client with puppet. It's
heavily inspired by the puppetlabs-ntp module.

## Module Description

This module handles installing, configuring and running the IBM Tivoli
Storage Manager (TSM) client on the following operating systems:

* RedHat Linux 5/6/7
* CentOS 5/6/7
* Oracle Linux 5/6/7
* Scientific Linux 5/6/7
* Solaris 10/11
* Debian 6/7
* AIX 7.1

## Setup

### What tsm effects

* TSM package (TIVsm-Ba and TIVsm-API)
* TSM configuration files (dsm.sys and InclExcl)
* TSM service (dsmsched)

### Setup requirements

#### RedHat

For RedHat Linux you need a yum repository that contains the rpm
packages IBM provides in the TSM installation tar.gz.

These usually are

* TIVsm-API64.x86_64.rpm
* gskssl64-8.0.14.26.linux.x86_64.rpm
* gskcrypt64-8.0.14.26.linux.x86_64.rpm
* TIVsm-BA.x86_64.rpm

#### Debian

For Debian you need an apt repository that contains the deb packages.
IBM only provides rpms so you might need to use alien to convert the
rpms IBM provides in the TSM installation tar.gz.
For info on converting rpms to debs consult:
http://www.planetcobalt.net/sdb/tsm_debian.shtml

These usually are

* tivsm-api64.deb
* tivsm-ba.deb
* gskcrypt64.deb
* gskssl64.deb

#### Solaris

For Solaris 10 and 11 you need a HTTP server that provides the
following packages for downloading:

* TIVsmCapi.pkg
* TIVsmCba.pkg
* gsk8cry32.pkg
* gsk8cry64.pkg
* gsk8ssl32.pkg
* gsk8ssl64.pkg

IBM provides the gsk packages as file systems packages (thanks IBM!),
so you have to translate them with pkgtrans:

```
$ pkgtrans . gskssl32.pkg gsk8ssl32/
```

and copy them to your HTTP download location. You are going to need two
download locations: one for sparc and one for i386 (see params.pp for
an example).

#### AIX

For AIX TSM is shipped by IBM as LPP in BFF format. The package can be
installed using the 'nim' (default) or 'aix' provider.  Installing
from a NIM repository, the variable `package_uri` must contain a valid
lpp_source in order to make the installation work.  This module will
then install `tivoli.tsm.client.ba.64bit.base` and its requesite
software.

By setting the 'service_manage' variable to true, 'dsmc sched' will be
added as a subsystem definition to the subsystem object class in AIX.

### Beginning with TSM

Include class TSM on hosts where you would like to install the TSM
client packages. By default no config files will be replaced. The
TSM class just makes sure the TSM packages are installed.

```puppet
include tsm
```

If there is no dsm.sys this module creates a new one from the default
template. Be sure to set *config_replace* to true if you would like
to manage dsm.sys after the default template has been deployed.

## Usage

All available options (see [init.pp](manifests/init.pp)) should be
changed via the main tsm class.

The default *dsm.sys* template only sets

* COMMMethod
* TCPPort
* TCPServeraddress

if you would like to add additional default options for nodes, you
have to use a hash (parameter *config_hash*) or hiera. Here's a hiera
example:

    tsm::config_hash:
        errorlogname: "/var/log/dsmerror.log"
        errorlogretention: "31 D"
        schedlogname: "/var/log/dsmsched.log"
        schedlogretention: "30 d"
        nodename: "%{::hostname}"
        inclexcl: "/opt/tivoli/tsm/client/ba/bin/InclExcl"
        inclexcl: "/opt/tivoli/tsm/client/ba/bin/InclExcl.other"
        passwordaccess: "generate"
        domain: "all-local"
        makesparsefile: "no"

There is also the possibility to add node local options to
*dsm.sys.local*. Settings in *dsm.sys.local* are going to be merged
into the global *dsm.sys* on the next puppet run.

Use the parameter *config_opt_hash* to manage *dsm.opt* in a similar way
as *dsm.sys*. There is currently no support for a local *dsm.opt* file.

### Defining multiple stanzas

You can also define your multiple servers by defining multiple
configuration stanzas.

example:

    tsm::stanzas:
      tsmserver1:
        tcp_server_address: "tsmserver1"
        config_hash:
          errorlogname: "/var/log/dsmerror.log"
          errorlogretention: "31 D"
          schedlogname: "/var/log/dsmsched.log"
          schedlogretention: "30 d"
          nodename: "%{::hostname}"
          inclexcl: "/opt/tivoli/tsm/client/ba/bin/InclExcl"
          inclexcl: "/opt/tivoli/tsm/client/ba/bin/InclExcl.other"
          passwordaccess: "generate"
          domain: "all-local"
          makesparsefile: "no"
        tsmserver2:
          tcp_server_address: "tsmserver2"

### The Include/Exclude file

If there is no */opt/tivoli/tsm/client/ba/bin/InclExcl* file
available, this module also deploys a default *InclExcl* file.

For a puppet managed include/exclude file set *inclexcl_replace* to
*true*.

In the case of a puppet managed include/exclude file, you can add
local include/exclude rules to
*/opt/tivoli/tsm/clien/ba/bin/InclExcl.local*

The default dsm.sys template already includes the *InclExcl.local*
file.

It is also possible to add InclExcl entries via hiera. Please use the
*inclexcl_hash* option for this:

```hiera
tsm::inclexcl_hash
  exclude:
  - /var/log/.../*
  - /var/tmp/.../*
```

The default location for the file generated with *tsm::inclexcl_hash*
is /opt/tivoli/tsm/client/ba/bin/InclExcl.hash. You can change this
with the *tsm::inclexcl_hash_source* option.

### Using the Client Acceptor Daemon (dsmcad)

If you want to use the Client Acceptor Daemon (dsmcad) instead of the Scheduler (dsmsched),
you have to overwrite the following variables.

Example for RedHat 7:

    tsm::service_script: "/etc/systemd/system/dsmcad.service"
    tsm::service_name: "dsmcad"
    tsm::service_script_source: 'puppet:///modules/tsm/dsmcad.redhat7'

## Reference

Please see [init.pp](manifests/init.pp) for an explanation of all available options.

## Limitations

This module has been built on and tested against Puppet 3.1.0 and higher.

The module has been tested on:

* RedHat Enterprise Linux 5/6/7
* Solaris 10 i386/sparc
* Solaris 11 i386/sparc
* Debian 6/7
* AIX 7.1
